This project utilizes a simple substitution of pharmaceutical abbreviations ascribed as "dangerous" by the NCC-MERP (The National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention) see <https://www.nccmerp.org/> .  Creation and distribution does not imply agreement with findings of the NCC-MERP assignation of "dangerous abbreviations."

The project originated in and was completed for a "lean-six-sigma" project under the auspices of the VHA, and upon its completed, conveyed in its entirety with all right, title and interest as herein described to the Veterans' Administration.
